Documentation

I will do my best to meet my original goal here, to instruct a user to create an account, create/edit/remove/post a flyer,
create/edit/remove a corkboard, and finally launch the corkboard.

I. Browser Dependency 
Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari

This is very, very important. This application uses jquery and html5. It's preferred to use Google Chrome as this
seems to yield the best results. I place a nice message on the home page to make this known. :)

I did not, however, get a chance to write a redirect script (i'll have it for the fair, just not now at turn in)
whereby this will send the user to the page so they can download the proper browser. 

Also, this uses a google maps api - this means that you should probably be on the internet when you're using it.

II. Server Side Requirements: LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

MYSQL Database - nowcorkitdb
- Information about the db, including username/passwords/etc can be found in the includes/constants.php. Please don't share
this file as it contains the user credentials to my third party server. - kthx

To setup the nowcorkitdb go to the SQL folder, and then I ask that you run the project.sql that has been created.
There are at total of 14 tables used for this application. Some of the data, such as "types", and "states" have been pre-populated.
I ask that these not be emptied for they are needed for this application.

Once the database is setup, one can simply copy the entire nowcorkit directory to a web folder. And, he or she can go to 
localhost/nowcorkit/ - this should automatically redirect you to the login screen. Here, one can register for an account.

Note: Although there is a link for "forgot your password", I actually forgot to implement this. It will be done sooner than later - hah, sorry.

I. Registration

- Click the blue register link, it will take you to registration.php where it should allow you to sign up for an account.
note: I've heard that the state drop down doesn't work correctly in with some browsers. I've never had this problem in Chrome, however.

II. Index

- Once registered, you'll be redirect to to the main menu where you are presented with a variety of options:
1. Create Flyer
 -> Create Text, Text&Image, or Image flyers here. 
 -> I would suggest creating a text flyer, which includes a QR code. This is interesting.
2. Flyer Manager
 -> Manage each of the flyers you've created, using edit, preview, or remove options. Note - You can not modify images, just the text associated
	to those images. 
3. Post Flyer
	-> You will be defaulted to the state you signed up with. However, this doesn't limit you to post in other states. The idea is that you first choose a state
	then after you choose a state, you can look at a list of locations in that state. After you choose a location, google maps will display address information
	about the location that you have chosen. The locations are the actual "corkboards" that are open for posting. Because you have just installed the application, 	  
	you probably will not have any locations to post to. This means we should create a board. On the left hand side of the menu, go to board manager.
	
4. Board Manager
	-> Board manager will list or provide you an option to create boards. When you choose to create a board, a modal will come up asking you to fill out some 			options. there are a few features that I haven't implemented yet such as "flyer shuffle" and "pay per space" feature, which gives people the ability to donate or pay for space for his or her flyer (and not be covered up by other flyers - like normal corkboards) 
	-> Once a feed is created, you can manage this feel from the drop down list. Under the drop down list you should have a variety of tab options available to such as Information - which lets you' display the board (more on this later)  or remove the board. Essentially, the tabs separate the each of the sections you had filled out in the "create board" modal screen. 

5. Posting to your board
	-> To post to your board, look at the state you created your board in. Once you have it listed in the location menu, use the "flyer" menu to choose which  	flyer you want to post to that board. Press the + symbol on the right will add the board. Afterwards, you should see a little "portable" created that tells you were you posted this flyer, what the title is, the status (posted, pending approval, not approved), and an option to remove it. 
	
6.  Display your board 
 -> All that for this? Nuts huh? The last thing I created, was this - the actual Corkboard. go back to board manager, and under the information tab, choose "display board". Here, you should see the corkboard that you created, along with the flyer that was posted. This page refreshes itself every 60 seconds to capture any new images that have been posted on it. The interesting part about this is that it will adjust depending on the screen size. For example, a 21 inch wide screen will let you display eight at a time. Interestingly enough, when new posts are added (and if the display is filled), the oldest posts are covered, however, they are not gone. They are z-indexed - behind the old ones (like a corkboard). when shuffling is implemented, I will eventually shift these out on an interval. If you created a text flyer w/ a qr code from the beginning, you should have a text flyer, that contains a qr code. If you scan this QR code, it will go to an API created that will generate this exact flyer on the fly - think of this as those "paper tabs" with phone numbers, to figure out how to contact this person. Now, you can take the flyer with you :).

If everything went well, you should have something similar to my "teaser_example.png" that is inside the documentation folder. Here, this is one text flyer, and two full images. 

that's it! - hit back to return to the menu.

and logout to logout!
