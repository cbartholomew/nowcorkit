1. When people post to your board, they show up under the post flyer menu of the user.
	-> Flyers posted to a board by user should show up in post flyer table (new), and posts 
	   from other users should only show up in your board settings.
	
2. Image uploading doesn't work with safari and chrome
	-> Perhaps adjust uploading method
